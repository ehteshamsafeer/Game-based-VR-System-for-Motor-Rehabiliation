# 🧠 EMG-Based VR Rehabilitation System for Hemiplegic Motor Disorders

This project is a **Final Year Project (FYP)** focused on developing an **EMG-driven Virtual Reality (VR) rehabilitation system** for patients with **hemiplegic motor disorders**.  
The system integrates **electromyography (EMG) signals** with immersive VR environments to enable **intent-based movement therapy**, real-time feedback, and patient engagement.

The goal is to explore how **biosignal-driven interaction in VR** can improve motor recovery, therapy compliance, and rehabilitation outcomes.
